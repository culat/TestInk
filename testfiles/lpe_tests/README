Add files with LPE test with this pattern in file name:
{LPENAME}{underscore}{small description to also avoid duplicate like px, mm multplpe or 001}{underscore}{{Underscores Inkscape file version}_.svg

This folder contains LPE to test. LPE test API has some parameters that can be helpful for fixing tests, especially legacy ones.
* inkscape:test-threshold="0.3" in the SVG element set a precision to all the tests. If it's in a single element, add to it. If it doesn't exist, use a default one 0.0001
* inkscape:test-ignore="true" skip this element from testing
